Titanium-Reindeer
-----------------

Titanium-Reindeer is a web based game framework written for Javascript using
Haxe. The current target for rendering is the canvas tag of HTML 5. The purpose
of this projec is to provide a comprehension suite of tools for making games of
all shapes and sizes. Haxe is used because it is staticly typed and provides many
useful language features that pure Javascript gravely lacks.

--Using the framework--

To compile the haxe code, run the compile.hxml for the particular project
and it will attempt to compile the Haxe code and create/modify a specified
javascript file.

To run the game you've compiled open an html page with the required tag
marked with the id specified in your game. For most examples this html file
is already provided. You should be able to open the file in your browser
and it will work. Ensure you are using Chrome, Firefox 4+, Internet
Explorer 9+ or Opera 10+ for full compatibility.
