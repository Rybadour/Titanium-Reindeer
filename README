Titanium-Reindeer is a collection of utilities for making video games.
Everything is written in Haxe and most of the rendering and asset code assumes
the game is running in a web browser. The remaining code can be used
independently and so can be useful in any of the languages Haxe supports.

Currently supported features are:
 - Game loop
 - Input management
 - Basic shape and image rendering
 - Basic 2D non-rotated collision detection
 - Collision R-Tree data structure for effiecent AABB lookups
 - Dozens of helpful functions for operating on 2D geometry and rotations
 - Tiling abstractions
 - Hexagonal tiling
 - Support for loading TMX files (Tiled editor files)
 - Asset loading
 - Basic Image Atlas
 - Pathfinding
 - Basic UI elements
 - Basic sprite/animation
